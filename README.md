# XamSpeak

XamSpeak allows you to take a photo of text and the app will dictate it aloud.

## About

XamSpeak is an iOS and Android app that will dictate text from a photo.

We are leveraging [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=xamspeak-github-bramin) to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Spell Check.
