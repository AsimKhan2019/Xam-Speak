# XamSpeak

XamSpeak allows you to take a photo of text and the app will dictate it aloud.

## About

XamSpeak is an iOS and Android app that will dictate text from a photo.

We are leveraging [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/) to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Spell Check.

## ToDo

To access the Microsoft Coginitive Services API from this app, sign up for a [free Computer Vision API Key](https://aka.ms/Yqx7kz) & a [free Bing Spell Check API Key](https://aka.ms/Uis4df) and insert it to the code [here](./Source/XamSpeak/Constants/CognitiveServicesConstants.cs#L8).
